## Project Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laligb/starter-code-frontend-shop
   cd starter-code-frontend-shop
   ```

2. **Run a Local Server**:

   - To serve the project on `localhost`, you can use any simple HTTP server. Here are a couple of options:

     **Using Node.js HTTP Server**:

     - If you have Node.js installed, you can install `http-server` globally and run it in the project directory:
       ```bash
       npm install -g http-server
       http-server -p 8080 .
       ```

     **Using Live Server in VS Code**:

     - Open the project folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
     - Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
     - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".
     - This will typically open the project on `http://localhost:5500` or similar; adjust the port if needed to match `8080`.

3. **View in Browser**:
   - After starting the server, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.

## Features

- **Shopping Cart Management**: Add, remove, and update products in the cart.
